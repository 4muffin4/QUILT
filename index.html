                    Quilt of Lies! We are a unique CalArts community space where people can share and reflect on the lies they've encountered, whether big or small. This platform is designed for those who have been lied to and are seeking a sense of connection and understanding in what can often feel like an isolating experience. Being lied to, especially repeatedly, can be disorienting and may chip away at your trust in others’ kindness. Lies, particularly when wielded as a tool of manipulation, can leave victims feeling defeated, embarrassed, or questioning their own reality.

                <h2 class="sub-heading">
                    Here, you can safely share the lies you’ve been told, open up meaningful discussions, and find solace in knowing you’re not alone. Whether you’re here to contribute or simply pass through, this space offers a chance to laugh, cry, and find a bit of healing in the shared experiences of believing others.
